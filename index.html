		<strong>Our objective was to study the change in the

			forecast the prices for the coming years to
			study its implications.<br>
			First, MS-Excel was used to
used to explore the Time
Series components and for
their graphical representation. Then,SPSS was used for
developing ARIMA
model and correlogram
and fitting of the model.

		The oil and gas industry is the lifeline of our modern global economy.
Nations have fought wars, or shaped their military strategy during a war,
to conquer oil fields or prevent rivals from controlling the commodity that
is the lifeblood of industrial economies and modern militaries.

For a developing nation like India, oil is truly the engine that drives the
Indian Economy. Over the years, we have seen an manifold increase in
the prices of petrol, despite the global price lowering to a great extent.
Indiaâ€™s dependence in
2019 has been as high
as 84% which is the
major cause of
increase in the prices
of oil.
	</p>
	<p>
		The data has been obtained
from the official website of
Indian Oil.A univariate time
series consisting of
secondary data on oil
prices for a period of
33 years. The trend component and cyclic component are dependent on each other as the correlation
coefficient between them is non 0, hence we chose the multiplicative

Model and not additive model.The observation that the data is non stationary because the mean of data is independent
of time where as the variance of data is dependent on time, so we took the logarithm of
the price of petrol and transformed it into stationary time series. ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. We used the above ARIMA model to predict the average price of
petrol for the year 2019, 2020 and 2021. In 2019, we predicted petrol price to be 74.61 and actaul price was 74.69 on average.
	</p>
	<p>
		As of 2019 , <b>our model came out to be our model came out to be
		95.7% accurate.</b> We predicted that the
		price of petrol
		will further
		increase by 17%.The price reached
		an all time high in
		2018 due to
		falling rupee
		value and rise
		in price of
		crude value. As observed in
		our multiplicative
		model, we see
		that <b>there is no
		cyclic variation in
		the price of petrol
		from 1985-2018.</b>
